Todo:

backend

- use rtmpsclient instead of kassadin
- figure out if there is memory leak

frontend

Features
    - Dates:
        - make dates show X min ago, X days ago like lolking
            - fuzzy time, jquery/javascript, if it works, remove the java code I wrote to try and do this...
        - show date when you hover over it, make this date use timezone of client's browser

    - Length:
        - show minutes instead of seconds

Bugs
    - zooming in and out of browser (ctrl scroll or ctrl +) messes up page
